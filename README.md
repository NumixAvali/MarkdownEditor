# **Project: Plugin-Based Markdown Editor**

## **1. Overview**

### **1.1 Project Summary**
This project aims to develop a **flexible, extensible Markdown editor** in **C#** with a **plugin system** that allows users to dynamically add new features. The core editor will support **Markdown parsing, live preview, and file management**, while plugins will enhance functionality (e.g., syntax highlighting, AI-assisted text suggestions, export options). The software should be built with **modular, maintainable, and scalable architecture**, leveraging **design patterns** for clean implementation.

### **1.2 Target Audience**
- Developers who frequently use Markdown for documentation.
- Technical writers who require an extensible and customizable writing tool.
- Open-source contributors who want to develop plugins and extend the core functionality.

### **1.3 Core Features**
✅ **Text editor with Markdown support**  
✅ **Live preview pane**  
✅ **Plugin system for extending functionality**  
✅ **File operations (open, save, export)**  
✅ **Customizable themes & UI**  
✅ **Undo/redo system**  
✅ **Cloud storage integration (optional)**

## **2. Technical Specification**

### **2.1 Technology Stack**
| Component | Technology |  
|-----------|------------|  
| Programming Language | **C# (.NET 8)** |  
| UI Framework | **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)** |  
| Markdown Parsing | **Markdig (popular Markdown parser for .NET)** |  
| Plugin System | **MEF (Managed Extensibility Framework)** |  
| Database (optional) | **LiteDB** |  

### **2.2 Design Principles**
- **Separation of Concerns (SoC)** – Different components (UI, logic, storage, plugins) will be clearly separated.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)** – Reduce coupling and increase testability.
- **Extensibility** – Designed for easy plugin integration via MEF.
- **Performance Optimization** – Efficient Markdown parsing and rendering.

### **2.3 Key Design Patterns Used**
✔ **Factory** – Creating Markdown parsers and export formats.  
✔ **Abstract Factory** – UI components and plugin elements.  
✔ **Proxy** – File system and cloud storage interactions.  
✔ **Observer** – Plugin communication with the editor.  
✔ **Command** – Undo/redo actions.  
✔ **State** – Different editor states (editing, read-only, collaborative).  
✔ **Chain of Responsibility** – Processing text through multiple filters (spell check, AI suggestions).  
✔ **Memento** – Auto-save and session recovery.

## **Core Requirements**

### **1. Base Markdown Editor**
- **Description:** The core application should provide a text editor supporting Markdown syntax with a live preview pane.
- **Patterns Used:**
  - [x] **Factory** – Create different types of Markdown parsers.
  - [x] **Abstract Factory** – Provide an interface for creating UI components (editor, preview pane, toolbar).
  - [ ] **Proxy** – Manage access to the file system and remote storage.
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement a text input area.
  - Implement a preview pane that updates as the user types.
  - Integrate a Markdown parser.
  - Provide basic file operations (open, save, autosave).

---

### **2. Plugin System**
- **Description:** The editor should support dynamically loaded plugins for additional features. Plugins should be able to register themselves, interact with the editor, and extend its capabilities.
- **Patterns Used:**
  - [x] **Factory** – Standardized creation of plugins with defined interfaces.
  - [x] **Abstract Factory** – Allow plugins to create their own UI components.
  - [ ] **Observer** – Enable plugins to listen to editor events.
  - [ ] **Command** – Implement plugin actions as commands for undo/redo support.
  - [ ] **Mediator** – Handle communication between the core editor and plugins.
- **Tasks:**
  - Define a plugin interface (e.g., register(), execute()).
  - Implement a plugin manager to load, enable, and disable plugins dynamically.
  - Create a sample plugin (e.g., syntax highlighting) to test the system.

---

### **3. UI & UX Improvements**
- **Description:** The editor should be easy to use with an intuitive UI, including a menu, toolbar, and settings panel.
- **Patterns Used:**
  - [x] **Abstract Factory** – Ensure consistency in UI elements like buttons, text fields, and menus.
  - [ ] **State** – Handle different editor states (editing, read-only, full-screen).
  - [ ] **Facade** – Provide a simplified interface for users to interact with complex features.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create a toolbar with buttons for common Markdown elements.
  - Implement a settings panel where users can configure editor preferences.
  - Add themes (light/dark mode).

---

### **4. File Management & Export**
- **Description:** Users should be able to open, save, and export files in different formats.
- **Patterns Used:**
  - [x] **Factory** – Create different file export strategies (Markdown, HTML, PDF).
  - [ ] **Bridge** – Separate file handling logic from export formats.
  - [ ] **Proxy** – Handle access to cloud storage APIs.
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement file opening and saving.
  - Implement export functionality (Markdown, HTML, PDF).
  - Allow integration with cloud storage services (optional).

---

### **5. Advanced Features & Plugins**
- **Description:** Additional features that enhance the editor’s functionality.
- **Patterns Used:**
  - [ ] **Prototype** – Allow cloning of complex document structures.
  - [ ] **Chain of Responsibility** – Process text modifications through a chain (e.g., spell check, grammar check, AI suggestions).
  - [ ] **Visitor** – Implement operations on the Markdown AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) for custom processing.
- **Possible Plugins:**
  - Spell checker
  - Syntax highlighting
  - AI-assisted text suggestions
  - Collaboration mode (real-time document editing)

---

### **6. Testing & Optimization**
- **Description:** Ensure the editor is stable, efficient, and user-friendly.
- **Patterns Used:**
  - [ ] **Memento** – Implement auto-save and session recovery.
  - [ ] **Iterator** – Support iteration over document elements for efficient processing.
- **Tasks:**
  - Write unit tests for core functionality.
  - Optimize Markdown parsing for performance.
  - Implement error handling and logging.

---

### **7. Deployment & Documentation**
- **Description:** Make the project easy to install, use, and contribute to.
- **Tasks:**
  - Package the editor as a standalone application.
  - Write user documentation.
  - Create developer documentation for plugin creation.

---

## **Expected Deliverables**
1. A functional Markdown editor with a live preview.
2. A plugin system that allows developers to extend the editor.
3. Several example plugins demonstrating functionality.
4. Full documentation for users and developers.
